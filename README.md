### Hello!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a full time Software Development student at Zip Code Wilmington (ZCW) learning the tools and technologies that will help jump-start my career. The curriculum at ZCW focuses on the Java language, including tools such as Maven and JUnit. MVC design patterns are learned through Spring, with a focus on SQL for databases. ZCW also provides training in Git and Agile. In order to round out my training, I am also learning JavaScript/TypeScript and REACT to build fully functional webapps. www.zipcodewilmington.com
