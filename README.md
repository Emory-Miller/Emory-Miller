### Hello!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a full time Software Development student at Zip Code Wilmington (ZCW) learning the tools and technologies that will help jump-start my career. The curriculum at ZCW focuses on the Java language, including tools such as Maven and JUnit. ZCW also provides training in Git, MySQL and Spring. In order to round out my training, I am also learning the basics of JavaScript and REACT to build fully functional webapps. www.zipcodewilmington.com
